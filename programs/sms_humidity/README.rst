Get humidity callback reading via SMS
-------------------------------------

This example demonstrates how Bricklet callback values can be reported
via SMS if you have a GSM modem connected to the RED Brick. In the source
file ``sms_humidity.py`` change the constants ``PHONE_NR`` and ``PIN_SIM``
according to your setup. If you have SIM card PIN disabled then you should
set the ``PIN_SIM`` constant to an empty string. By default the callback
has a period of 1 minute.

Upload this program to the RED Brick using Brick Viewer's Program wizard
with the following program settings:

* 1 of 8:

  * Name: SMS Humidity
  * Language: Python

* 2 of 8:

  * Add the complete directory containing the ``sms_humidity.py`` script.

* 3 of 8:

  * Version 2.x.y
  * Start Mode: Script File
  * Script File: ``sms_humidity.py``

* 4 of 8: Add argument ``/dev/ttyUSB0``. Usually this is the case but depending
  on your modem it can be some other device file as well. If you see in log the
  message ``ERROR: Failed to initialize modem`` try changing this argument.
* 5 of 8: Default
* 6 of 8: Default
* 7 of 8: Nothing
* 8 of 8: Start Upload
